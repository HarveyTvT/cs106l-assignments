Q1. It is your choice to use either an ordered or unordered set. In a few sentences, what are some of the tradeoffs between the two? Additionally, please give an example (that has not been shown in lecture) of a valid hash function that could be used to hash student names for an unordered set.
A1. ordered set will be more space efficient but cost more time to search, unordered set wil be more time efficient but cost more space to mantain bucket. Hash function: (sum value of all each char in string)

Q2. Note that we are saving pointers to names in the queue, not names themselves. Why might this be desired in this problem? What happens if the original set where the names are stored goes out of scope and the pointers are referenced?
A2. It may cause memory leak. When the original set goes out of scope, it will be destructed but the pointers will still be pointing to the memory location of the names.
